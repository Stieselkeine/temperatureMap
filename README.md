## My Quest of Finding some weird Point on Earth
I read online, that there is proof that there always has to be one point on earth, 
where the temperature and the air pressure is the same asx on the opposite site. 

To look at [this](junq.info/?p=3126) forthe whole explanation. 

So full of joy and happiness from this mathematical proof I told my classmates about it, and some got it immediatley, 
but two of them didn't want to believe it, they said I had to think about the elevation and time and all of that.....


*So i decided I had to make a viualisation*, and I did. Here it is. Of course this is no proof, that there always has to be such a point, 
but hey, it's something... 

Thanks to DarkSky for providing a source for the 18000 data points, which made this project possible.
